// Introduction
In the highly competitive retail industry, customer retention and acquisition are crucial for sustained growth. This project focuses on analyzing key data from a retail company to devise effective retention strategies. By leveraging SQL queries, we will extract insights from various datasets to understand customer behavior, identify satisfaction drivers, and formulate actionable strategies.

Data Overview
The datasets available for analysis include:
i. Transaction Document: Records of transactions including order dates, employee IDs, customer IDs, product IDs, quantities, payment methods, and discounts.
ii. Return Table: Details of returned products, including reasons for returns and conditions of items.
iii. Customer Document: Customer profiles with demographic information and contact details.
iv. Product Document: Product details such as categories, prices, and stock levels.
v. Store: Information on store locations, addresses, warehouse capacities, and major issues faced.
vi. Employee: Employee details including their roles and hire dates.

Create the tables & import the dataset

Starting with Transaction Table as Transaction_Doc//

CREATE TABLE Transaction_Doc(
    Serial_Number NUMERIC,
    Transaction_ID VARCHAR(100) PRIMARY KEY,
    Order_Date DATE,
    Employee_ID VARCHAR (100),
    Customer_ID VARCHAR(100),
    Product_ID VARCHAR(100),
    Quantity_Supplied NUMERIC,
    Payment_Method VARCHAR(50),
    Discount_Rate NUMERIC,
    Tax_Details NUMERIC,
    Refunds_and_Chargebacks VARCHAR(10)
       )

// Import the dataset into the table//

COPY Transaction_Doc
 FROM 'C:\Users\USER\Desktop\Project 1\Transaction_Doc.csv'DELIMITER','


//Inspect the table//

SELECT *
 FROM Transaction_Doc
